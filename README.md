# Salary-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
Built a linear regression model to predict salaries based on candidate experience, test scores, and interview performance. The dataset included missing values, which were handled using median imputation. Trained and evaluated the model using Scikit-learn's LinearRegression, demonstrating how predictive analytics can be applied to hiring scenarios.
